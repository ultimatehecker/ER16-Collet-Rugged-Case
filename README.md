## About The Project
Many tools we have in a machinist shop use ER16 collets, for me its our cnc router and the lathe. I needed to keep my collets organizaed in something that
can be easily transported without getting damaged or breaking. Therefore I made this case to be able to keep these organized wheil ebeing easy to be transported.
